#### STAT 705 FALL 2018 ASSIGNMENT 2
#### NAME:

#### If in a question I refer to a function that we have not seen in class, 
#### then use the help facility to find out about it.
#### Insert your answers under each question.
#### Submit your solutions to Canvas as a plain text file.

#### Download the .Rdata file called "hw2_2018.Rdata" available on Canvas and read it in to R using R-studio.
#### This will bring all the objects you need for the homework straight into R-studio.


#### Q1. (6pts. )You will have imported a list called "mystery.list".
#### Inspect the list and describe briefly in words what is in it.

#a. Description:

#b. Use two different R syntaxes for extracting *just* the number of passengers who fly through PHL (not the sub-list containing the number of passengers).


#b(i)

#b(ii)

#c The country for Chandigarh is incorrect. It is in India. Write code to correct this mistake in the list and then print the corrected list.

#d Write code to add the airport nearest your hometown to the list along with its relevant attributes, and print just this new 
#  element of the updated list (if you don't know the attributes, guess them!)



#### Q2 (20pts.)

#a. What is a key difference between a matrix and a data frame?

# You will have read in a data frame called  "tsla.df" which contains information on the price of Tesla stock

#b How many rows and columns does this data frame have?

#c On which day was Tesla's stock price maximized? Show your code that identifies the day. 
#  The function "which.max" can be very useful.

#d Create and add to the data frame a new column called "Return" that calculates the daily relative return
#  of Tesla stock. The Daily Return is defined as (price today - price yesterday)/price yesterday.
#  I suggest that you build this vector outside of the data frame, and when complete, "cbind" it into the 
#  data frame. The first element in this "return" vector will have to be an NA (without quotes) because there is no preceding day for it.
#  Provide your code that builds the return vector and the code that adds it back into the data frame.
#  There are many ways to create this vector of returns, but you may want to have a look at the "diff" function 
#  as an elegant way to perform the calculation. Use the "head" function to print the first 5 rows of the data frame
#  that now includs the Retun variable.


#e. What was Tesla's average daily return over this time period? To deal with the NA, use the "na.rm" 
#   argument to the "mean" function.

#f. What was the standard deviation of Tesla's daily return over this time period?

#g. There is a column in the data frame called "DayOfWeek". It has been entered numerically, 1 for Sunday etc.
#   Turn "DayOfWeek" into an *unordered* factor and overwrite the old DayOfWeek variable in the data frame.
#   Show your code that creates and inserts the factor day-of-week variable.

#h. The "by" command is useful for summarizing one variable over the levels of a categorical/factor variable. 
#   Read about the "by" command using R's help function.

#   Using the "by" command, find which Day of the week had the highest average daily return for Tesla stock.
#   Because the mean  for Friday will be NA due to the first day's return being NA, you will need to pass
#   the "na.rm = TRUE" argument into the mean function when "by" applies it.
#   In the function syntax:
#   by(data, INDICES, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE)
#   the three dots "..." is a special slot where you can pass in arguments to the function FUN. 
#   This will allow you to find the mean daily return for Friday too. 
#   You need to write code to find the best day-of-the-week and then extract the mean return in the best day-of-the-week.   

#   Code:
#   Best day-of-the-week:
#   Average return in best day-of-the-week:


#### Q3 Regression (12pts.) 

#a Using the tsla.df data frame, run a regression of Tesla returns 
#  against daily volume and store the answer as a variable.


#b Write code to extract the slope and intercept, RMSE and R^2 for the regression.

#c Now add in the categorical variable, DayOfWeek, to the regression. Is Day of Week, in the presence of the
#  daily volume, a statistically significant predictor of Tesla's return?   
#  Show the code  you used to generate the relevant output as well as your conclusion.

#d Finally, include in the regression the interaction between Volume and Day of Week. 
#  Is this interaction  term statistically significant? Again, post your code and state a conclusion.



#### The lapply function
#### Q4. (12pts.) you will have read in a list called "gala.list". It contains the text based responses 
#### to a survey question that asked individuals what they liked "least" about a gala event.
#### The names in the list are respondent IDs (coerced to characters) and the associated element is the text response.

#a. Using repeated applications of the "lapply" command and "unlist" command, write R code to find
#   which respondent wrote the most words in their answer. Recall that "strsplit" will split a character string
#   and the "length" command will count how many elements there are in a vector. The command "which.max" will identify
#   the maximum element in a vector. Hint: you need to realize that "strsplit" itself returns a list structure.
#   To get things started, lapply(gala.list,strsplit," ") breaks each respondent's answer into distinct words
#   There are alternative approaches to doing this question, but I want you to use lapply.

#b. Briefly explain each what each step in the code you wrote for part (a) does.  In particular, describe the 
#   data structure (vector, matrix, list, etc.) returned by each function you call.
