    "# Longsvale has undergone rapid development from a 18 block square to 36 blocks.\n",
    "# The goal of these questions is to estimate the number of cars (level of \n",
    "# effort) that need to be available in order to meet a pre-specified level of \n",
    "# service. We will assume that there are at least as many cars as passengers \n",
    "# waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# This pre-specified level of service is that the average wait time for \n",
    "# passengers is no longer than 4 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# As a reminder, here is the preamble about the town:\n",
    "# Longsvale is an interesting town because it is laid out in a perfect city \n",
    "# grid and has exactly 36 blocks in both the north and east directions. Roads \n",
    "# going north-south are called Avenues, and roads east-west are called streets.\n",
    "# The driverless car will only pick up and drop people off at street \n",
    "# intersections.\n",
    "# This means that every car and every passenger's location can be represented \n",
    "# as a pair (i,j),\n",
    "# i for the street they are on, and j for the avenue, where both i and j take \n",
    "# integer values between 1 and 36.\n",
    "# The city planners used the convention that the intersection at the south west \n",
    "# corner of the grid is (1,1) and the intersection in the north east corner \n",
    "# is (36,36).\n",
    "\n",
    "# The city also operates its time on a very discrete level, only working in \n",
    "# minute increments. A car can move one block in one minute."

    "#Q1. (41pts.) Write a function called \"run.sim\", that runs a simulation, where \n",
    "# the function takes the following four arguments:\n",
    "#    num.cars --- the number of cars initially available.\n",
    "#    num.passengers --- the number of passengers initially waiting for a ride.\n",
    "#    grid.size --- the size of the Aresville city grid (default to 36).\n",
    "#    num.its --- the number of iterations in the Monte Carlo simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The function should return a one column matrix, with the number of rows equal \n",
    "# to num.its. \n",
    "# The elements in this matrix should be the average time that passengers wait \n",
    "# to be picked up (where the average\n",
    "# is taken over all passengers within an iteration).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Because grid.size is now a variable you will want to add an extra argument to \n",
    "# your \"newpassenger\" and \"newcar\" \n",
    "# functions from Assignment 5, to reflect this fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The problem you will face in this question is that in Assignment 5, the \n",
    "# number of cars equalled the number of passengers,\n",

    "# the number of cars then the\n",

    "\n",
    "# The trick here, when the number of cars does not equal the number of \n",
    "# passengers, is to pad the distance matrix\n",
    "# with *zeroes* (not NAs), so that it becomes square. If we have cars as rows \n",
    "# and passengers as columns in the distance matrix,\n",
    "# and there were 20 cars and 10 passengers, then you would need to add 10 \n",
    "# columns of 20 rows each to make the distance\n",
    "# matrix square. Because these extra columns (phantom passengers) are \n",
    "# constructed with all zero entries they don't change\n",

    "# Equivalently, you could create a distance matrix as square and full of \n",
    "# zeroes, and then just compute the elements\n",
    "# that correspond to actual passengers. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Bottom line: you have to add in an extra step as compared to Assignment 5, \n",
    "# where you ensure that the \n",
    "# distance matrix is square if necessary, before calling \"lp.assign\"."
